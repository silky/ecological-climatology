# Exercises from the book "[Ecological Climatology](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9e783c08-67e4-48c2-ae11-0fa5450336ac)"

This is a work in progress. No promises that the exercises are answered
correctly!

### Building

It uses [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).


### Running

```
stack repl
> :l src/Chapter3a
> plot $ map round q1a
```
